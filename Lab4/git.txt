After cloning the directory and running git branch, I can see that my cloned local repository only has master, while the repository on seasNET has branches for maint, master, next, seen, todo. The underlying reason for this difference is that my cloned repository by default only clones the main branch, while the seasNET repository has had other branched downloaded. It is worth noting that both repository master branches are identical and up to date with the actual repository.
